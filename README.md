## Introduction

-----------------

Now it is 22:15 in a snowy and shivering night, you stand on a railway platform, waiting for the last train of the day to go home after a big day. Your home is 100 miles away from where you work.

Suddenly, a gust of wind comes and you hear the sound of the train. At the same time, the station broadcasting says the train will arrive after 15 minutes. “It is quite strange” you whisper quietly.

## Gaming rules

-----------------

There are two stages in total. For the first stage, the player needs to make appropriate choices to advance the story, and different choices may have an impact on subsequent gameplay (being killed or moving to the next level). 

If the right choice is made, the player can move on to the second stage, which is the main part of our game.

The map on the second level is a dungeon, the player can move by pressing (W, A, S, D), the % in the map represents the wall, M represents the elite monster which will grow with the story, m represents the miscellaneous monsters(their battle information is constant), the number indicates the story, and # represents the secret door (passing through it will be teleported to another location on the map). 

During the game, if the player meet any of the monsters, the player will automatically enter the battle screen, if the player is able to kill the monster and win, the player will have 5 seconds to choose whether to enter the bonus level, if the player chooses to enter the bonus level, they will play a keyboard presssing game, if passed, they can get a reward in the normal box. If the player loses the match, the game ends and the game will restart from the player's last saved record(if the player has saved, if not, the game will restart from the stage 1).
