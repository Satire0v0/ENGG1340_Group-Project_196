## Gaming process

-----------------

There are two stages in total. For the first stage, the player needs to make appropriate choices to advance the story, and different choices may have an impact on subsequent gameplay (being killed or moving to the next level). 

If the right choice is made, the player can move on to the second stage, which is the main part of our game.
